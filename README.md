This package implements cryptographic operations required by the AT Protocol, using Apple's [swift-crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto) and compatible libraries.
ATCryptography supports the following cryptographic systems:
- "p256," otherwise known as "secp256r1" or "NIST P-256."
- "k256," otherwise known as "secp256k1" or "NIST K-256."

The library provides helpers for key management, signing, verification, hashing, and encoding. These utilities are aligned with AT Protocolâ€™s cryptographic requirements, including low-S signatures, byte representation compression, and string encodings.

For details on cryptography in the AT Protocol, refer to the [Cryptography section](https://atproto.com/specs/cryptography) of the specification.

## Installation
You can use the Swift Package Manager to download and import the library into your project:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ATProtoKit/ATCryptography.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Then under `targets`:
```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        // name: "[name of target]",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "ATCryptography", package: "atcryptography")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Requirements
ATCryptography is designed to be a server application. For a Linux server, Swift 6.0 or later is required. The minimum requirements include:
- **Amazon Linux** 2
- **Debian** 12
- **Fedora** 39
- **Red Hat UBI** 9
- **Ubuntu** 20.04

You can also use it on macOS. Please target **macOS** 13 or later.

You can also use this project for any programs you make using Swift and running on **Docker**.

> [!WARNING]
> As of right now, Windows support is theoretically possible, but not has not been tested to work. Contributions and feedback on makjng it fully compatible for Windows and Windows Server are welcomed.
